# ConquerGame

This is an excercise project i am making in java.

The premise is simple: You, the player, are a budding new promise of the future,
but to fare well in this world, you must gain influence through diplomatic and 
sometimes brutish means.

This is achieved by completing challenges, which you can start when you have enough experience,
or sometimes a powerful friend can give you a tip for where to start you next adventure.

You influence is represented by power. You start at 0 power, and your objective is to get to 100 power.

Once you power up to 100, you win the game.
